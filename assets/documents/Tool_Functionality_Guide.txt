User Guide: The Co-Parenting Compass (Parenting Plan Tool)This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of how to use the FLAMEA Parenting Plan tool. Its purpose is to help you create a detailed, fair, and legally sound document that will serve as the roadmap for your co-parenting journey.Part 1: Getting StartedWhen you first navigate to the Parenting Plan tool, you are presented with two choices. This is to ensure the tool meets your specific needs.Assessment & Wizard:Who it's for: This path is highly recommended if you are unsure where to begin, are planning for a child, or are in the early stages of separation.What it does: It will first take you through a short assessment. Based on your answers, it will offer recommendations and then guide you step-by-step through building the plan, pre-filling some information where possible.Manual Builder:Who it's for: This path is for users who know exactly what they need in their plan or wish to create a plan from a blank slate.What it does: It takes you directly to the multi-step wizard without the initial assessment.Part 2: The Plan Builder WizardWhether you choose the wizard or the manual path, you will use our powerful Plan Builder. This is a multi-step form designed to capture all essential details.Step 1: The People InvolvedPurpose: To legally identify all parties covered by the plan.Information Required:Parent A & Parent B Names: Enter the full legal names.Parent A & Parent B Birthdays: Use the calendar pop-up to select the date.Child's Status: Select from the dropdown if the child is Not yet conceived, Expecting, or Born.If not yet born: A field will appear allowing you to enter the child's name if you have chosen one, but it is not required.Child's Full Name & Birthday: If the child is born, these fields are required.Parent's Residential Addresses: Enter the current street address for both parents. The tool will use this information to calculate distances for visitation planning if needed.Knowledge Nugget: The law recognizes both parents as individuals with rights and responsibilities. Clearly identifying everyone is the first step in a legally sound document.Step 2: Custody & Primary ResidencePurpose: To define the legal and physical living arrangements for the child.Information Required:Primary Residence: Select from the dropdown who the child primarily lives with (Father, Mother, Maternal Extended Family, Paternal Extended Family, or Shared Residence).How this was Decided: Select from a dropdown (By Mutual Consent, By Court Order, Currently in Dispute). This is critical for legal clarity.Freehand Comments: An area is provided to add specific details, such as the date of the court order or specific conditions of the agreement.Knowledge Nugget: The Children's Act focuses on what is best for the child.

The percentage for Parent B will automatically update to ensure it always adds up to 100%.The tool will calculate and display the total monthly contribution for each parent.Knowledge Nugget: Financial disagreements are a major source of conflict.
