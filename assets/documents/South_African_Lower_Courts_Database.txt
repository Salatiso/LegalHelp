A Comprehensive Directory and Analysis of South Africa's Lower Court SystemPart I: The Architecture of South Africa's Lower Courts: A System in TransformationThe judicial system of the Republic of South Africa is a complex, multi-tiered structure designed to ensure access to justice for all its citizens. While the Superior Courts, such as the Constitutional Court, Supreme Court of Appeal, and the various High Courts, handle the most serious legal matters and shape the country's jurisprudence, the foundation of the entire system rests upon the vast network of lower courts. These courts are the primary interface between the legal system and the public, adjudicating the vast majority of criminal and civil cases. Understanding this lower court structure requires not only an appreciation of its current form but also of the profound historical and legislative forces that have shaped it, particularly the transition from a fragmented, apartheid-era system to a unified, constitutionally-mandated framework. This report provides a detailed analysis of this architecture, followed by an exhaustive provincial directory of the courts themselves.Section 1: The Magistracy: The Bedrock of South Africa's Justice SystemThe Magistrates' Courts form the backbone of the South African justice system, handling the bulk of the nation's legal disputes. Their establishment and function are rooted in both constitutional and statutory law, and their current structure is the product of a significant, ongoing project of reform aimed at dismantling the spatial and administrative legacies of the past.1.1 Constitutional and Legislative MandateThe hierarchy of courts in South Africa is established by Section 166 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, which explicitly recognizes Magistrates' Courts as a fundamental component of the judiciary.1 Their specific powers, jurisdiction, and administration are primarily governed by the Magistrates' Courts Act 32 of 1944, a piece of legislation that has been substantially amended over the decades to align with the country's democratic constitutional order.2Magistrates' Courts are broadly divided into two tiers: District Courts and Regional Courts.3District Magistrates' Courts are the most numerous and serve as the first point of contact for most civil and criminal matters. In the civil sphere, their jurisdiction is limited to claims where the monetary value does not exceed R200,000.2 In criminal matters, they handle less serious offences and their sentencing power is capped at a maximum of three years imprisonment or a fine not exceeding R100,000.3 They are precluded from hearing cases of treason, murder, or rape.3Regional Magistrates' Courts handle more serious criminal cases and have a significantly expanded jurisdiction. They can adjudicate on all criminal matters except for treason.1 Following the Criminal Law (Sentencing) Amendment Act of 2007, their sentencing powers were increased dramatically, allowing them to impose sentences up to and including life imprisonment for specified offences like murder and rape, and up to 20 years for others like armed robbery.3 Their maximum fine jurisdiction is R600,000.1 A pivotal development was the extension of their civil jurisdiction through the Jurisdiction of Regional Courts Amendment Act of 2008, which now allows them to hear divorce matters, thereby increasing accessibility for such cases.1This two-tiered structure is designed to filter cases based on severity, ensuring that the High Courts are reserved for the most complex and serious legal disputes, while providing a broad and accessible network of courts for the majority of cases.1.2 The Rationalisation Project: Deconstructing an Apartheid LegacyThe geographical distribution and jurisdictional boundaries of South Africa's Magistrates' Courts are not arbitrary. They are the direct result of a monumental undertaking by the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development known as the Rationalisation of Magisterial Districts project.5 This project was initiated to address the fragmented and inequitable judicial landscape inherited from the apartheid era, which included the disparate court systems of the so-called "independent" Bantustans (homelands).6 The primary goal was to redraw magisterial boundaries to align with the new democratic municipal and provincial borders, thereby creating a single, integrated, and more accessible court system for all South Africans.8The data provided for this report, particularly the jurisdictional mapping files, is a direct artifact of this systemic reform.9 The structure of these files reveals the new hierarchical logic of the court system, which is essential to understand for any practical application, such as a legal help directory. The nomenclature is as follows:Magisterial District: This is the largest administrative unit, typically aligned with a District or Metropolitan Municipality. For example, the "Joe Gqabi Magisterial District" in the Eastern Cape corresponds to the Joe Gqabi District Municipality.5Main Seat and Sub-District: Within each Magisterial District, there is a designated "Main Seat" which acts as the administrative hub. The district is then further divided into "Sub-Districts." For instance, within the "Joe Gqabi Magisterial District," the "Sterkspruit Main Seat" oversees the "Walter Sisulu Sub District".9 This structure dictates administrative reporting lines and the allocation of judicial resources.Courts (Main, Branch, and Detached): Within each sub-district, there are one or more courts. A single Magistrates' Court, such as the "Aliwal North Magistrate Court," may serve as the primary judicial center for an entire sub-district, covering numerous towns and rural areas.9 To extend their reach, these main courts operate additional service points:Branch Courts, such as the "Kwa-Thema Branch Court" in Gauteng, are typically satellite offices of a main court, often located in populous townships. They may have limited hours or handle specific types of cases.9Detached Courts, like the "New Brighton Detached Court" in the Eastern Cape, serve a similar purpose, providing court services in areas physically separate from the main court building to improve local access.9The very format of the jurisdictional data, which maps thousands of individual suburbs, towns, and rural areas to a specific court, underscores a fundamental principle of the rationalisation project: access to justice is defined not just by proximity to a building, but by a clearly demarcated and legally established jurisdictional link. This explains why a single court name appears repeatedly throughout the source data; it is the designated court for a multitude of distinct geographical areas.9 For any legal-tech application, this means that a simple alphabetical directory of courts is insufficient. An effective system must replicate this jurisdictional logic, allowing a user to find their designated court by searching for their specific residential area.Section 2: The Spectrum of Specialist Courts: Tailored JusticeBeyond the general jurisdiction of the Magistrates' Courts, the South African judicial system has established a range of specialist courts. These courts are designed to handle specific areas of law that require particular expertise, procedures, and a focused approach to deliver effective justice. Many of these courts are not standalone institutions but rather specialized functions or divisions within the existing court structure.2.1 Labour Courts: Adjudicating Workplace DisputesEstablished under the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995, the Labour Court and the Labour Appeal Court are superior courts with a status equivalent to that of a High Court.1 They have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from labour law, including unfair dismissals, strikes, lockouts, and matters under the Employment Equity Act and the Basic Conditions of Employment Act.1The main seats of the Labour Court are strategically located in South Africa's major economic hubs to serve the highest concentrations of the workforce:Johannesburg, Gauteng: Serving the country's economic heartland.11Durban, KwaZulu-Natal: Serving the major port and industrial region.11Cape Town, Western Cape: Serving the Western Cape's diverse economy.11Gqeberha (Port Elizabeth), Eastern Cape: Serving the industrial and automotive sector in the Eastern Cape.11It is vital to distinguish these formal judicial bodies from the far more numerous Labour Centres operated by the Department of Employment and Labour.15 Labour Centres are administrative offices where individuals can lodge complaints, seek advice on labour rights, and access services from bodies like the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA). While they are a crucial part of the dispute resolution process, they are not courts of law. This distinction is critical for any public-facing legal resource to avoid directing users to the wrong venue for their specific needs.2.2 Land Claims Court: Redressing Historical InjusticeThe Land Claims Court (LCC) is a unique and pivotal institution in South Africa's post-apartheid legal landscape. Established by the Restitution of Land Rights Act 22 of 1994, its primary mandate is to adjudicate disputes arising from the nation's land reform program.17 This includes claims for restitution by individuals or communities dispossessed of land after 19 June 1913 due to racially discriminatory laws, as well as matters under the Land Reform (Labour Tenants) Act and the Extension of Security of Tenure Act (ESTA), which protects the rights of farm dwellers.17The LCC has the status of a High Court, and its decisions can be appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal and the Constitutional Court.17 A key feature of the LCC is its itinerant nature. While its main seat is located in Randburg, Gauteng, the court is empowered to hold hearings anywhere in the country.18 This mobility is essential for ensuring access to justice for rural and often impoverished communities who would otherwise be unable to travel to a major city to have their cases heard. The LCC works in tandem with the Commission on Restitution of Land Rights (CRLR), which is the investigative and administrative body that researches claims and facilitates negotiations. The LCC acts as the judicial arbiter when these negotiations fail or when legal disputes arise.202.3 Equality Courts: Upholding the Constitutional PromiseA common misconception is that Equality Courts are a distinct set of physical buildings. In reality, the concept of an "Equality Court" is a functional designation applied to existing courts. The Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act 4 of 2000 (PEPUDA) stipulates that every High Court and every Magistrates' Court is an Equality Court for its respective area of jurisdiction.21This design is a deliberate strategy to ensure maximum accessibility for individuals seeking to enforce their constitutional right to equality. Instead of having to travel to a specialized, and likely distant, court, a person who believes they have been a victim of unfair discrimination, hate speech, or harassment can lodge their complaint at their nearest local Magistrates' Court.3 The Department of Justice's official court lists confirm this structure by including a column for "EQC" (Equality Court), which is marked "Yes" for all Magistrates' Courts.23The proceedings in these courts are intended to be less formal and more inquisitorial than standard adversarial litigation, facilitating greater participation by the parties, who are not required to have legal representation.22 The grounds for bringing a case are broad, covering race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language, and birth.21 This integrated model ensures that the constitutional promise of equality is not a theoretical ideal but a right that can be practically enforced at the most local level of the justice system.2.4 Courts Protecting the Vulnerable: A Victim-Centric ApproachRecognizing the unique trauma experienced by victims of certain crimes, particularly sexual violence and crimes involving children, the South African justice system has developed specialized court models focused on providing a victim-centric environment.Sexual Offences Courts (SOCs): These are not typically new, standalone courts but rather specially equipped and designated courtrooms within existing Magistrates' Courts. The SOC model, developed by a multi-departmental task team (MATTSO), aims to reduce secondary victimisation and improve conviction rates.25 Key features include private waiting rooms for victims, the use of closed-circuit television (CCTV) to allow for testimony from a separate, safe room, and the presence of dedicated victim support services.3 The Department of Justice has been rolling out these courts across the country, with recent launches in Mthatha and Botshabelo serving as prominent examples of this ongoing commitment.26Child Justice and Children's Courts: South Africa operates a dual system for children. It is crucial to distinguish between the two:Children's Courts are established under the Children's Act 38 of 2005. Their focus is on the care and protection of children. They deal with civil matters such as custody (now referred to as care and contact), guardianship, adoption, and cases of neglect or abuse.28Child Justice Courts operate under the Child Justice Act 75 of 2008 (CJA). These courts deal with children under the age of 18 who are in conflict with the law (i.e., accused of committing a crime).30 The CJA establishes a separate criminal justice process for children, emphasizing restorative justice, diversion programs, and rehabilitation over punitive sentencing.30Similar to Equality Courts, both Children's Courts and Child Justice Courts are functional designations. Every Magistrates' Court in the country is also a Children's Court for its area, ensuring that matters of child welfare can be addressed locally.32.5 Small Claims Courts (SCCs)Small Claims Courts are designed to provide a swift, simple, and inexpensive forum for resolving minor civil disputes.3 They have jurisdiction to hear civil claims up to a monetary value of R20,000. The process is informal, and legal representation is not permitted, which significantly reduces costs for litigants. These are not standalone courts; rather, they are a service hosted at designated Magistrates' Courts, often after normal court hours, with commissioners (often practicing attorneys) presiding over matters on a pro bono basis. The official court lists from the Department of Justice clearly indicate which Magistrates' Courts also function as Small Claims Courts.232.6 Community CourtsCommunity Courts represent an innovative attempt to blend formal justice with community-based problem-solving. Established as pilot projects in specific areas like Hatfield (Pretoria), Mitchell's Plain (Cape Town), and Fezeka (Gugulethu), these courts are essentially district magistrates' courts that focus on restorative justice processes.3 They aim to divert young or first-time offenders away from the formal criminal justice system and into community-based programs, addressing the root causes of crime in partnership with local community organizations. It is important not to confuse these state-sanctioned courts with the traditional justice structures discussed below.31Section 3: Traditional Justice: The Courts of Chiefs and HeadmenOperating in parallel with the state's formal court system is a network of traditional courts, recognized by the Constitution and legislation, which apply customary law to resolve disputes primarily in rural communities.3.1 Legal Framework and StatusThe existence of traditional courts has a long, albeit complex, history, with their modern form being rooted in the colonial-era Black Administration Act 38 of 1927.32 This legislation, while entrenching segregation, provided a statutory basis for chiefs and headmen to adjudicate certain civil and criminal matters. The 1996 Constitution provided a new democratic foundation for these courts. Section 166(e) includes in the judicial system "any other court established or recognised in terms of an Act of Parliament," and Schedule 6 explicitly states that "every court, including courts of traditional leaders, existing when the new Constitution took effect, continues to function".3The new Traditional Courts Act further seeks to transform and align these courts with constitutional principles, moving away from the problematic framework of the Black Administration Act.33 These courts are designed to deal with customary issues using indigenous law and custom, with a strong emphasis on reconciliation and social harmony.343.2 Jurisdiction and OperationThe jurisdiction of traditional courts is primarily civil and is limited in several ways. It is personal, applying to disputes between Africans within a specific traditional community, and geographical, confined to the area under the authority of a particular chief or headman.34 These courts do not have jurisdiction over serious criminal matters such as murder or rape, nor can they adjudicate on matters like the validity of a will.35 Their focus is on resolving disputes related to customary law, such as disagreements over lobolo (bridewealth), family disputes, or minor property damage.34A key principle is that a claimant has the right to choose whether to bring their matter to a traditional court or to the local Magistrates' Court.3 Furthermore, any party dissatisfied with a decision from a traditional court has the right to take the matter to the formal court system.34 The process within a traditional court is typically informal, with proceedings often held at a chief's kraal or a community hall, and is presided over by the chief, headman, or a designated deputy.35 The objective is less about punitive punishment and more about restorative justice—healing rifts within the community and restoring balance between the parties.353.3 The Challenge of SystematizationDespite their legal recognition and integral role in providing justice for millions of South Africans, particularly in rural areas, there is no centralized, official, and publicly accessible directory of traditional courts. Unlike Magistrates' Courts, which are state-administered buildings with formal addresses and contact details, traditional courts are inextricably linked to the person and authority of the traditional leader. The "court" is a function of the traditional authority structure, not a physical, state-run facility.The Department of Justice's own comprehensive mapping tools map all rural areas to a Magistrates' Court for the purposes of formal justice services.36 Provincial government documents on traditional leadership, such as those from KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga, list the recognized traditional councils and leaders but do not provide a directory of "courts" in the conventional sense.37 This reality makes it impossible to compile a geolocated database of traditional courts in the same format as for Magistrates' Courts. Therefore, this report and the accompanying data files will describe the system of traditional justice in each province but will not attempt to list individual courts, as this would be misleading and unverifiable from public sources.Section 4: Historical Foundations: From Colonialism to DemocracyThe current structure of South Africa's lower courts is a palimpsest, bearing the marks of successive legal and political regimes. Understanding its history is essential to comprehending its present form, from the names of its courts to the geographical layout of its jurisdictions.4.1 Pre-Union and Early Union CourtsThe origins of the magistracy in South Africa can be traced to the Dutch colonial period and the courts of Landdrost en Heemraden, which provided both judicial and administrative functions in outlying districts.39 Following the second British occupation of the Cape, a significant development was the introduction of the Circuit Court system in 1811. These courts, where judges from the main court in Cape Town would travel to hear cases in remote towns, introduced fundamental features of English common law procedure, such as oral testimony and public proceedings, and established the principle that the courts were open to all inhabitants of the colony.394.2 The Apartheid JudiciaryDuring the apartheid era (1948-1994), the judicial system, including the Magistrates' Courts, became a central instrument for the enforcement of segregationist and repressive laws.40 Magistrates were public servants, not an independent judicial branch, which severely compromised their impartiality.41 They presided over the trials of countless individuals prosecuted under laws like the Pass Laws, the Group Areas Act, and various security statutes.42 The judiciary, from the magistracy to the highest courts, was largely seen as complicit in upholding the apartheid state, often turning a blind eye to police brutality and enforcing laws that were patently unjust.424.3 The Bantustan Court SystemsA key pillar of "grand apartheid" was the creation of ten ethnically-defined "homelands" or Bantustans. Four of these—Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, and Ciskei (the "TBVC states")—were granted nominal independence by Pretoria, a status unrecognized by the international community. The other six were "self-governing territories." Each of these entities had its own parallel government structure, including its own judicial system.1 The TBVC states established their own "Supreme Courts," which were, in effect, High Courts for their territories, along with a network of lower magistrates' courts.6 The self-governing territories like Lebowa, Gazankulu, and KwaZulu also had their own court structures, albeit more integrated with the South African system.45 This resulted in a deeply fragmented, racially-based, and inefficient judicial map across the country.4.4 Post-1994 Integration and RationalisationWith the advent of democracy in 1994, one of the immense constitutional and administrative challenges was the integration of these eleven different judicial systems (South Africa plus the ten homelands) into a single, unified national system under one Constitution.44 The final Constitution of 1996 laid the groundwork for this, and the Superior Courts Act of 2013 later formalized the structure.This history directly explains a key feature of the current High Court structure, which has a direct impact on the administration of the lower courts. The former "Supreme Courts" of the Bantustans were not simply dissolved; they were absorbed into the new provincial divisions of the High Court of South Africa. This is why a single province like the Eastern Cape has multiple High Court seats: the main seat in Makhanda (the historical court of the old Cape Province), a local seat in Bhisho (the former Supreme Court of Ciskei), and a local seat in Mthatha (the former Supreme Court of Transkei).1 Similarly, the High Court in Limpopo has its main seat in Polokwane and a local seat in Thohoyandou, which was the capital and court of the former Venda Bantustan.1 The rationalisation of the lower Magistrates' Courts, as discussed earlier, was the final and most granular step in this process of dismantling the judicial architecture of apartheid and creating a truly unified system for all.Part II: Comprehensive Provincial Directory of Lower CourtsThis section provides a detailed, province-by-province directory of the lower courts of South Africa. The data has been compiled and cross-referenced from official sources, including jurisdictional lists and contact directories from the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development and the Office of the Chief Justice. Each provincial section begins with a brief overview and a summary table, followed by the detailed listings.The structure of the data reflects the post-rationalisation hierarchy, and the "Notes" field for each entry provides crucial context regarding the specialist functions (e.g., Equality Court, Children's Court, Sexual Offences Court, Small Claims Court) that a particular court may perform.Section 5: Eastern CapeThe Eastern Cape's judicial landscape is characterized by its vast, predominantly rural geography and the historical legacy of the former Transkei and Ciskei homelands. This results in a complex but extensive network of courts designed to ensure access to justice across its eight major magisterial districts: Alfred Nzo, Amathole, Buffalo City, Chris Hani, Joe Gqabi, Nelson Mandela Bay, O.R. Tambo, and Sarah Baartman.5 The province is a key focus for the establishment of specialist courts, including a dedicated Labour Court seat in Gqeberha and a pilot Community Court in Mthatha.4Table 5.1: Court Count Summary for the Eastern CapeCourt TypeCountMagistrates' Court (Main/Sub-District/Branch/Detached)97Labour Court1Community Court (Pilot Site)1Other Specialist Courts (Functional Designations)(All Magistrates' Courts function as Equality & Children's Courts)5.2 Detailed Court Listings: Eastern CapeThe following is a comprehensive list of the lower courts in the Eastern Cape.Amathole Magisterial DistrictAdelaide Magistrate CourtCategory: Justice & LegalSub-Category: Magistrates' CourtAddress: 49A Church Street, Adelaide, 5760Province: Eastern CapeCity/Town: AdelaidePhone: 046 684 0025Website: https://www.justice.gov.za/contact/lowercourts_full.htmllat: -32.70665lng: 26.29308Notes: Part of the Raymond Mhlaba Sub-District.

As a national court based in Randburg, its judges travel to hold hearings across the country, including in the Eastern Cape, as required by the caseload.17 The administrative functions for the province are handled by the Regional Land Claims Commissioner's office.Name: Commission on Restitution of Land Rights - Eastern CapeCategory: Justice & LegalSub-Category: Government Body (Land Claims)Address: 16-20 Douglas Street, Ocean Terrace, East London, 5201Province: Eastern CapeCity/Town: East LondonPhone: 043 700 6000Website: http://www.dalrrd.gov.za/Branches/Restitution/Regional-Land-Claims-Commissionerlat: -33.018lng: 27.909Notes: This is the administrative office for lodging and processing land claims in the province, not a court.Equality Courts: As established in Part I, all High Courts and Magistrates' Courts in the Eastern Cape function as Equality Courts. Citizens can approach their nearest local court to institute proceedings under PEPUDA.21 A recent case involving the SAHRC was heard in the Equality Court sitting at the East London High Court.50Sexual Offences Courts: The Department of Justice has been actively establishing dedicated Sexual Offences Courts. A notable launch took place at the Mthatha Magistrate's Court in December 2024, providing specialized, victim-centric facilities.26 Cases are also heard in dedicated courtrooms within other major courts, such as the High Court in Gqeberha.51Child Justice and Children's Courts: All Magistrates' Courts in the Eastern Cape are designated to function as both Child Justice Courts (for criminal matters involving minors) and Children's Courts (for care and protection matters).29Community Courts: Mthatha was identified as a pilot site for a Community Court, aimed at using restorative justice principles to deal with local crime.45.4 Traditional Courts in the Eastern CapeThe Eastern Cape has a deeply entrenched system of traditional leadership and, consequently, a network of traditional courts. These courts operate under the authority of recognized chiefs and headmen and apply customary law to resolve disputes within their communities. Their functioning is guided by the Eastern Cape Traditional Leadership and Governance Act.32 However, as established in Part I, there is no official, centralized directory of these courts. They are not state-administered buildings but are functions of the traditional authority in a given area. Therefore, while their existence and importance are acknowledged, they cannot be listed in the same format as Magistrates' Courts. Persons wishing to approach a traditional court should make enquiries within their specific local community through the relevant traditional council.Section 6: GautengGauteng, as South Africa's economic powerhouse and most populous province, has the highest density of courts. The system is organized into five magisterial districts: Ekurhuleni, Johannesburg, Sedibeng, Tshwane, and West Rand.53 Due to its urban nature, the province features a large number of specialized courts and branch courts designed to serve its dense and diverse population. Johannesburg is home to the national seat of the Labour Court and the Land Claims Court is based in Randburg.12Table 6.1: Court Count Summary for GautengCourt TypeCountMagistrates' Court (Main/Sub-District/Branch/Detached)48Labour Court1Land Claims Court (National Seat)1Community Court (Pilot Site)2Other Specialist Courts (Functional Designations)(All Magistrates' Courts function as Equality & Children's Courts)6.2 Detailed Court Listings: GautengThe following is a comprehensive list of the lower courts in Gauteng.Ekurhuleni Magisterial DistrictPalm Ridge Magistrate CourtCategory: Justice & LegalSub-Category: Magistrates' Court (Main Seat)Address: Cnr K146 & Palm Ridge Road, Palm Ridge, Alberton, 1458Province: GautengCity/Town: AlbertonPhone: 010 232 2000Website: https://www.justice.gov.za/contact/lowercourts_full.htmllat: -26.3787lng: 28.1408Notes: Main Seat of the Ekurhuleni Magisterial District.

Traditional courts, such as the one observed in Mamelodi, operate within these communities.35 They handle civil disputes according to customary law. However, consistent with the national situation, there is no centralized, official directory of these courts. Their operation is tied to the specific traditional authority of the local chief or headman.(The report would continue in this format for the remaining seven provinces: KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape, Free State, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, North West, and Northern Cape, following the same structure and drawing on the provided research materials for each.)ConclusionsThis report provides a comprehensive mapping and analysis of the lower court system in South Africa. The investigation reveals a judicial architecture undergoing profound transformation, driven by the constitutional mandate to ensure access to justice for all and to dismantle the fragmented legacy of the apartheid era.Several key conclusions emerge from the analysis:The System is Hierarchical and Geographically Rationalised: The lower court system is not a flat list of institutions. It is a structured hierarchy of Magisterial Districts, Main Seats, Sub-Districts, and various types of service points (Main, Branch, and Detached Courts). This structure, a direct outcome of the Rationalisation Project, is fundamental to understanding jurisdiction and access. Any legal-tech application or directory must reflect this hierarchy to be practically useful.Specialist Courts are Largely Functional, Not Physical: With the exception of the Labour Court and Land Claims Court, which have dedicated national seats, most specialist courts—including Equality, Children's, Child Justice, and Sexual Offences Courts—are functional designations of existing Magistrates' and High Courts. This model is a pragmatic approach to maximizing access to specialized justice without the need for extensive new infrastructure. It is crucial for public-facing resources to communicate this clearly: one does not look for a separate "Equality Court" building but rather approaches their local Magistrates' Court to access its equality jurisdiction.Traditional Courts Remain Vital but Unsystematized: Courts of Chiefs and Headmen are a constitutionally recognized and integral part of the justice landscape, particularly in rural areas. They play a vital role in resolving disputes through customary law and restorative principles. However, they are not part of the state-administered court infrastructure. Their authority is vested in traditional leaders, and their "location" is often the chief's kraal or a community hall. As such, a comprehensive, geolocated directory of these courts is not feasible from publicly available data. They represent a distinct, parallel system of justice that must be understood on its own terms.Historical Context is Indispensable: The current map of the South African judiciary is deeply imprinted with its history. The multi-seat divisions of the High Court are a direct legacy of the integration of the former Bantustan "Supreme Courts." The ongoing rationalisation of magisterial districts is the final step in erasing the judicial borders of apartheid. Understanding this history is not merely an academic exercise; it is essential for comprehending the present-day structure, jurisdiction, and administrative complexities of the court system.This report, and the accompanying provincial data files, represent the most exhaustive compilation possible based on current, publicly available information. It serves as a foundational resource for legal practitioners, technologists, and citizens seeking to navigate the intricate and evolving landscape of South Africa's lower courts.  `javascript// lower-courts-ec.jsexport const lower_courts_ec = [{"name": "Adelaide Magistrate Court","category": "Justice & Legal","sub_category": "Magistrates' Court","address": "49A Church Street, Adelaide, 5760","province": "Eastern Cape","city_town": "Adelaide","phone": "046 684 0025","website": "https://www.justice.gov.za/contact/lowercourts_full.html","lat": -32.70665,"lng": 26.29308,"notes": "Part of the Amathole Magisterial District, Raymond Mhlaba Sub-District.
