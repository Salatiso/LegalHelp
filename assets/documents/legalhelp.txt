Prompt for Next Development Session
Objective: Continue the development of the LegalHelp hub.

Context: We have established the final name ("LegalHelp"), chosen the UI design (Variation 1: Tabbed Interface), and created the complete initial file structure, including the index.html, CSS, main.js, and the modular JavaScript data files (data_national-legislation.js, data_case-law.js, etc.).

Next Steps:

Populate Data Files: The current data files (data_*.js) contain placeholder content. The next task is to begin populating them with the real, comprehensive legal text as outlined in the project's technical documentation.

Start with data_national-legislation.js, adding the full text of the Constitution's Preamble and Bill of Rights, and the key sections of the Children's Act.

For each entry, expand the object to include more detail, such as fullText, enactedDate, amendments, and commentary.

Enhance the UI:

Modify the renderContent function in main.js to display this new, more detailed information. For example, when a user clicks on an Act, it should expand to show its full text or key sections.

Implement a "Copy Citation" button for each legal entry.

Create a dedicated "About" tab with content explaining the mission and vision of LegalHelp.

Develop the Flamea Interface:

Create the flamea-interface.html file. This will be a simple HTML structure that represents how the LegalHelp content will be displayed inside the flamea.org website. It should have placeholders for a title, search bar, and content area.

Modify the main.js in the LegalHelp project to include a function renderForFlamea(). This function will demonstrate how the legal data can be fetched and injected into the flamea-interface.html template, styled with Flamea's brand colors (which would be defined in a separate CSS file for that specific implementation). This demonstrates the "headless" concept.

Please proceed with these next steps.
